### How to run locally 

Before running: 
1. Run npm install to download dev dependencies
2. Create two files, an .env.development file && an .env.test file
3. Add PGDATABASE= with the correct database name for each (can be found/renamed in setup.sql)
4. Set up a .gitignore file && add your environment variables and node_modules 

Enjoy!
